# floream-we-are

With over 150 employees and quickly growing at Floream, as developers, it's hard to keep track of who's who. So we have created a website as part of our Floream Dev Day to help us and others quickly put a face to the name.

Hope you enjoy our little project

## Development Instructions

Create a database called ```wearefloream``` and start the application. It should automatically create the required tables.
No special credentials are required because it uses your integrated security.
